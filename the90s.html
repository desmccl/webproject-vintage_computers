                The Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, or TAM, made an appearance in the 1997 movie Batman and Robin! It can be seen being used by Alfred to write a disk to his brother. This is a capability the device did not actually have. This computer, released to celebrate Apples 20th Anniversary where it received it's name,  was intended as a media machine aimed at the "executive" market. It featured custom made Bose speakers and a subwoofer connected by an "umbilical cord". 
                It had a vertically mounted 4x SCSI CD-ROM and an Apple floppy Superdrive, a 2GB ATA hard drive, a TV/FM tuner, and an S-Video input card. The original price tag of $7,499 did not impress and after the computers short lifespan of 1 year it saw a price cut to $1,500!

                Also making an appearance, the Apple eMate 300, seen being used by Batgirl to hack the very disk Alfred entrusted her with! The Apple eMate was created with students in mind and meant for classroom use. It ran the same Newton operating system as Apple's PDAs. With a release price of $799 the eMate featured a 6.8" 480x320 resolution 16-shade grayscale display with a backlight, stylus pen, keyboard, infrared port, and standard Macintosh serial/LocalTalk ports.
                It had a built-in recharcgable battery that lasted 28 hours from full charge. The eMate 300 weighed 4lbs and came with 1MB of memory. These mini-laptops came with expansion slots under the battery door to expand the memory and flash storage.  Companies like Newertech produced cards for the eMate. Most cards expanded the data bus from 16 bits to 32 bits, as well as providing additional DRAM (program memory), and flash (storage).
                When one of these cards was installed, the internal DRAM was disabled, but the internal flash RAM is combined with the flash on the card.
