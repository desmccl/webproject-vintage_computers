           I have always been interested in technology and how it works. I find that understanding the tech of the past helps me to understand the current technology we have. 
           It began for me when I started repairing and building PCs. I wanted to know more about what led to the amazing components we have available to us and what used to be considered "top of the line". This led me down a rabbit hole of the best processors and graphics cards and sound cards available. 
           Soon I transistioned from just PCs to Apple products and found a whole new world of computers to study. I started to notice things like the TAM mentioned in the 1990s page and found myself down a new rabbit hole!
           It is quite fascinating to see how things have changed and what remains the same. I have put together a sample of what i've studied on Apple computers from the past and hope you enjoy it as I just geek out a bit over these amazing devices!
